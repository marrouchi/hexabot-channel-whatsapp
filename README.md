## Usage

- Media messages
- Quick replies
- Interactive lists

## Note

Currently, WhatsApp does not support URL buttons natively. As a workaround, we handle scenarios with a single URL button by leveraging WhatsApp's "Call to Action" (CTA) component.

For cases requiring multiple URL buttons, you can create a specific flow tailored to the WhatsApp channel. This flow involves sending successive messages, each containing a single URL button attached as a CTA. By structuring your flow this way, you ensure that all URL buttons are presented effectively while adhering to WhatsApp's limitations.
